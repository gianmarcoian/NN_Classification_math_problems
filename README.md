# NN Classification for Math Problems (ITA)

This repository contains a neural network capable of efficiently classifying math problems, categorizing them into various types of mathematical fields:

- 3D geometric figures in spatial diagrams
- Arithmetic
- Crypto-arithmetic
- Geometric figures in spatial diagrams or puzzles
- Numbers in spatial diagrams
- Spatial reasoning
- Temporal reasoning

## Neural Network Approach

Several neural networks have been trained, and the best results were achieved by a neural network that utilizes a GlobalAveragePooling1D layer on the embeddings, which is an unusual approach to the problem.

## Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- **Esercizi matematici**: Contains the validation, training, and test datasets.
- **storico**: A report of the experiments, including a log file.
- **Versioni_progetto**: Different versions of the solution.

The latest and best results can be found in **Versioni_progetto/PROGETTO_2**.

## Usage
